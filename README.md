# OPERATIONAL ANALYTICS

Overview-
As we embark on our operational analytics journey, our goal is to understand and optimize various operational processes within our organization. This journey will involve data cleaning with Excel, data management and query resolution with MySQL, and visualization using Power BI.

Approach-
We'll employ a three-pronged approach to achieve our objectives:

1. Data Cleaning with Excel
Excel will be our primary tool for cleaning and refining raw data.
We'll ensure accuracy and consistency in our datasets before proceeding with further analysis.
Excel's functionalities will be utilized to handle missing values, remove duplicates, and format data appropriately.
2. Data Management and Query Resolution with MySQL
Once our data is polished in Excel, we'll transfer it to MySQL for further processing.
MySQL's robust capabilities will enable us to load, organize, and query datasets efficiently.
Using SQL queries, we'll address pertinent business questions and extract valuable insights to drive operational improvements.
3. Visualization Using Power BI
Power BI will be used to visualize our data and insights effectively.
Interactive dashboards and reports will be created to present data in a user-friendly and intuitive manner.
Stakeholders will gain actionable insights at a glance, facilitating informed decision-making and strategic planning.
Benefits-
This comprehensive approach will enable us to uncover hidden trends and patterns in our operational data.
By optimizing processes and enhancing operational efficiency, we'll drive performance improvements across the organization.
Stakeholders will have access to timely and relevant information, empowering them to make data-driven decisions.
